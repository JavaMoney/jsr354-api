/**
 * Provides the ability to build a formatter by programmatic defining the
 * formatting required. The implementing class should add additional
 * configuration methods returning itself as the method's result, for example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public final class MyFormatterBuilder implements FormatterBuilder<MyItem>{
 * 
 *   public MyFormatterBuilder setPlaceBeforeX(booleanplaceBefore){
 *     ...
 *   }
 * 
 *   ...
 *   
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * FormatterBuilders are mutable and intended for use by a single thread. A new
 * instance should be created for each use. The formatters produced by the
 * builder are immutable and thread-safe.
 *

 * @see StyleableItemFormatter
