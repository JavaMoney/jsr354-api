/**
 * Instances of this class can be registered using the {@link ServiceLoader}
 * API. The parser runtime will ask each registered instance for a parser given
 * the style provided, until an instance will return a non-null instance of
 * {@link AmountParser}. This instance finally will be returned to the client.
 * <p>
 * Note that the parser runtime does not perform any caching of instances
 * returned. It is the responsibility of the implementations of this interface,
 * to implement reuse of resources, where useful. Nevertheless keep in mind that
 * synchronization of shared resources can lead to severe performance issues.
 * Therefore in most of the cases it is reasonable to create a new formatter
 * instance on each access and to delegate caching aspects to the client using
 * this API. Similarly it is not required that the instances returned by the SPI
 * must be thread safe. If a thread safe instance of a formatter is required,
 * one of {@link MoneyFormat#synchronizedParser(ItemParser)},
 * {@link MoneyFormat#synchronizedAmountParser(AmountParser)} can be used to
 * obtain a synchronized instance of a {@link ItemParser} or {@link AmountParser}.
