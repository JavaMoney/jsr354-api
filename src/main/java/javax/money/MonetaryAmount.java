/**
 * Interface defining a monetary amount. The effective format representation of an amount may vary
 * depending on the implementation used. JSR 354 explicitly supports different types of monetary
 * amounts to be implemented and used. Reason behind is that the requirements to an implementation
 * heavily vary for different usage scenarios. E.g. product calculations may require high precision
 * and scale, whereas low latency order and trading systems require high calculation performance for
 * algorithmic operations.
 * <p>
 * Each instance of an amount provides additional meta-data in form of a {@link MonetaryContext}.
 * This context contains detailed information on the numeric capabilities, e.g. the supported
 * precision and maximal scale, as well as the common implementation flavor.
 *
 * Also a {@link MonetaryAmount} provides a {@link NumberValue}, which allows easily to extract the
 * numeric value, of the amount. And finally {@link #getFactory()} provides a
 * {@link MonetaryAmountFactory}, which allows to of instances of {@link MonetaryAmount} based
 * on the same numeric implementation.
 * <p>
 * This JSR additionally recommends to consider the following aspects:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Arithmetic operations should throw an {@link ArithmeticException}, if performing arithmetic
 * operations between amounts exceeds the capabilities of the numeric representation type used. Any
 * implicit truncating, that would lead to complete invalid and useless results, should be avoided.
 * This recommendation does not affect format rounding, as required by the format numeric
 * representation of a monetary amount.
 * <li>Monetary amounts should allow numbers as argument for arithmetic operations like division and
 * multiplication. Adding or subtracting of amounts must only be possible by passing instances of
 * {@link MonetaryAmount}.</li>
 * <li>Nevertheless numeric truncation is also explicitly supported when calling
 * {@link NumberValue#numberValue(Class)}, whereas the <i>exact</i> counterpart,
 * {@link NumberValue#numberValueExact(Class)}, works similar to
 * {@link java.math.BigDecimal#longValueExact()}.
 * <li>Since implementations are recommended to be immutable, an operation should never change any
 * format state of an instance. Given an instance, all operations are required to be fully
 * reproducible.</li>
 * <li>Finally the result of calling {@link #with(MonetaryOperator)} must be of the same type as
 * type on which {@code with} was called. The {@code with} method also defines additional
 * interoperability requirements that are important to enable this invariant.</li>
 * <li>To enable further interoperability a static method {@code from(MonetaryAmount)} is
 * recommended to be implemented on each implementation class, that allows conversion of a
 * {@code MonetaryAmount} to a concrete instance. E.g.a class {@code MyMoney extends MonetaryAmount}
 * would contain the following method:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * public final class MyMoney implements MonetaryAmount{
 *   ...
 *   public static MyMoney from(MonetaryAmount amount)(...)
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * </blockquote></li>
 * </ul>
 * <h4>Implementation specification</h4>
 * Implementations of this interface must be
 * <ul>
 * <li>thread-safe</li>
 * </ul>
 * Implementations of this interface should be
 * <ul>
 * <li>final</li>
 * <li>serializable, hereby writing the numeric value, the {@link MonetaryContext} and a serialized
 * {@link CurrencyUnit}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Implementations of this interface must be
 * <ul>
 * <li>thread-safe</li>
 * <li>immutable</li>
 * <li>comparable</li>
 * <li>must implement {@code equals/hashCode}, hereby considering
 * <ul>
 * <li>Implementation type
 * <li>CurrencyUnit
 * <li>Numeric value.
 * </ul>
 * This also means that two different implementations types with the same currency and numeric value
 * are NOT equal.</li>
 * </ul>

     * <p>
