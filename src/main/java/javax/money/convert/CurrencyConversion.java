/**
 * This interface defines a {@link CurrencyConversion} that is converting a {@link MonetaryAmount} to another
 * {@link MonetaryAmount} with a different target {@link CurrencyUnit}. Each instance of this class is bound to
 * a specific {@link ExchangeRateProvider} (or a chain of rate providers), a term {@link CurrencyUnit} and
 * (optionally) a target timestamp. Additionally the {@link javax.money.convert.ConversionContext} can have additional
 * attributes setTyped that are passed to the rate provider (chain).
 * <p>
 * This interface serves a an API for the clients, but also must be implemented
 * and registered as SPI to the mechanisms required by the
 * {@link javax.money.spi.MonetaryConversionsSingletonSpi} implementation.
 * <p>
 * By extending {@link MonetaryOperator} currency conversion can simply be applied on each {@link MonetaryAmount}
 * calling the amount'0s with method:
 * <pre>
 *     MonetaryAmount amount = ...;
 *     CurrencyConversion conversion = MonetaryConversions.getConversion("CHF");
 *     MonetaryAmount amountInCHF = amount.with(conversion);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The terminating {@link CurrencyUnit} of this conversion instance can be
 * accessed from {@code getCurrency()}, inherited from {@code CurrencySupplier}.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class are required to be thread-safe, but it is not a
 * requirement that they are serializable. In a EE context they can be
 * implemented using contextual beans.
