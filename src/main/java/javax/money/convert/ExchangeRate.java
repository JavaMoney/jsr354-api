/**
 * This class models an exchange rate, which defines the factor the numeric value of a base amount in some currency
 * 'A' must be multiplied
 * to getTyped the corresponding amount in the terminating currency 'B'. Hereby
 * <ul>
 * <li>an exchange rate always models one rate from a base (source) to a term
 * (target) {@link CurrencyUnit}.</li>
 * <li>an exchange rate is always bound to a rate type, which typically matches
 * the data source of the conversion data, e.g. different credit card providers
 * may use different rates for the same conversion.</li>
 * <li>an exchange rate may restrict its validity. In most of the use cases a
 * rates' validity will be well defined, but it is also possible that the data
 * provider is not able to support the rate's validity, leaving it undefined-</li>
 * <li>an exchange rate has a provider, which is responsible for defining the
 * rate. A provider hereby may be, but must not be the same as the rate's data
 * source.</li>
 * <li>an exchange rate can be a <i>direct</i> rate, where its factor is
 * represented by a single conversion step. Or it can model a <i>derived</i>
 * rate, where multiple conversion steps are required to define the overall
 * base/term conversion. In case of derived rates the chained rates define the
 * overall factor, by multiplying the individual chain rate factors. Of course,
 * this also requires that each subsequent rate's base currency in the chain
 * does match the previous term currency (and vice versa):</li>
 * <li>Whereas the factor should be directly implied by the internal rate chain
 * for derived rates, this is obviously not the case for the validity range,
 * since rates can have a undefined validity range. Nevertheless in many cases
 * also the validity range can (but must not) be derived from the rate chain.</li>
 * <li>Finally a conversion rate is always unidirectional. There might be cases
 * where the reciprocal value of {@link #getFactor()}} matches the correct reverse
 * rate. But in most use cases the reverse rate either has a different rate (not
 * equal to the reciprocal value), or might not be defined at all. Therefore for
 * reversing a ExchangeRate one must access an {@link ExchangeRateProvider} and
 * query for the reverse rate.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * The class also implements {@link Comparable} to allow sorting of multiple
 * exchange rates using the following sorting order;
 * <ul>
 * <li>Exchange rate type</li>
 * <li>Exchange rate provider</li>
 * <li>base currency</li>
 * <li>term currency</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * Finally ExchangeRate is modeled as an immutable and thread safe type. Also
 * exchange rates are {@link Serializable}, hereby serializing in the following
 * form and order:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The base {@link CurrencyUnit}
 * <li>The target {@link CurrencyUnit}
 * <li>The factor (NumberValue)
 * <li>The {@link ConversionContext}
 * <li>The rate chain
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * <h3>Implementation Specification</h3>
 * <p>Implementations of this interface
 * <ul>
 * <li>must be Comparable(with {@code ExchangeRate})</li>
 * <li>must implement equals/hashCode considering #getBaseCurrency, #getCurrency,
 * #getFactor and #getConversionContext.</li>
 * <li>should be thread-safe</li>
 * <li>should be serializable</li>
 * <li>should provide a fluent builder API for constructing new rate instances easily.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </ul></p>
