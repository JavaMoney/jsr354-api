/**
 * Main package of the Money and Currency API. In more detail:
 * <ul>
 * <li>JSR 354 defines a minimal setTyped of interfaces for interoperability, since
 * concrete usage scenarios do not allow to define an implementation that is
 * capable of covering all aspects identified. Consequently it must be possible
 * that implementations can provide several implementations for monetary
 * amounts.
 *
 * Users should not reference the interfaces, instead the value types should be
 * used.</li>
 * <li>Implementations must provide value types for currencies and amounts,
 * implementing {@link javax.money.CurrencyUnit} and
 * {@link javax.money.MonetaryAmount}.</li>
 * <li>Implementations must also provide a minimal setTyped of roundings, modeled as
 * {@link javax.money.MonetaryRounding}. This should include basic roundings for
 * ISO currencies, roundings defined by {@link java.math.MathContext} or
 * {@link java.math.RoundingMode}.</li>
 * <li>This API must avoid restrictions that prevents its use in different
 * runtime environments, such as EE or ME.</li>
 * <li>Method naming and style for currency modeling should be in alignment
 * with parts of the Java Collection API or {@code java.time} / [JodaMoney].</li>
 * </ul>
