/**
 * This class models an exchange rate, which defines the factor the numeric value of a baseCurrency amount in some
 * currency
 * 'A' must be multiplied
 * to getTyped the corresponding amount in the terminating currency 'B'. Hereby
 * <ul>
 * <li>an exchange rate always models one rate from a baseCurrency (source) to a termCurrency
 * (target) {@link javax.money.CurrencyUnit}.</li>
 * <li>an exchange rate is always bound to a rate type, which typically matches
 * the data source of the conversion data, e.g. different credit card providers
 * may use different rates for the same conversion.</li>
 * <li>an exchange rate may restrict its validity. In most of the use cases a
 * rates' validity will be well defined, but it is also possible that the data
 * provider is not able to support the rate's validity, leaving it undefined-</li>
 * <li>an exchange rate has a provider, which is responsible for defining the
 * rate. A provider hereby may be, but must not be the same as the rate's data
 * source.</li>
 * <li>an exchange rate can be a <i>direct</i> rate, where its factor is
 * represented by a single conversion step. Or it can model a <i>derived</i>
 * rate, where multiple conversion steps are required to define the overall
 * baseCurrency/termCurrency conversion. In case of derived rates the chained rates define the
 * overall factor, by multiplying the individual chain rate factors. Of course,
 * this also requires that each subsequent rate's baseCurrency currency in the chain
 * does match the previous termCurrency currency (and vice versa):</li>
 * <li>Whereas the factor should be directly implied by the internal rate chain
 * for derived rates, this is obviously not the case for the validity range,
 * since rates can have a undefined validity range. Nevertheless in many cases
 * also the validity range can (but must not) be derived from the rate chain.</li>
 * <li>Finally a conversion rate is always unidirectional. There might be cases
 * where the reciprocal value of {@link #factor} matches the correct reverse
 * rate. But in most use cases the reverse rate either has a different rate (not
 * equal to the reciprocal value), or might not be defined at all. Therefore for
 * reversing a ExchangeRate one must access an {@link ExchangeRateProvider} and
 * query for the reverse rate.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The class also implements {@link Comparable} to allow sorting of multiple
 * exchange rates using the following sorting order;
 * <ul>
 * <li>Exchange rate type</li>
 * <li>Exchange rate provider</li>
 * <li>baseCurrency currency</li>
 * <li>termCurrency currency</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Finally ExchangeRate is modeled as an immutable and thread safe type. Also
 * exchange rates are {@link java.io.Serializable}, hereby serializing in the following
 * form and order:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The baseCurrency {@link javax.money.CurrencyUnit}
 * <li>The target {@link javax.money.CurrencyUnit}
 * <li>The factor (NumberValue)
 * <li>The {@link ConversionContext}
 * <li>The rate chain
 * </ul>
